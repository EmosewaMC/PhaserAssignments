# How does this project satisfy the 8 guidelines?
- 5 Scenes
- 2 Audio assets
- 5 Image assets
- 2 Geometric shapes
- 1 logotype text (TimeSplitters font used on the menu themed slide
- 2-3 Multi-line text blocks
- 1 fading scene transition (studio logo to ship sailing)
- 2 object motion animations (ship in ocean sliding left)

Ocean is from `https://www.thoughtco.com/why-is-the-ocean-blue-609420`.  I chose this simply because I wanted a good looking ocean and this was the first one I found that was decent.
Audio is from TimeSplitters 2 and Armor Games.  Armor games audio was chosen because I was always a fan of their intros and the TimeSplitters 2 music was chosen because I love the game.
Goldfish is from `https://www.mysis.com/hobbyist/species/goldfish/`.  I liked the goldfish, what else can I say?  
All other assets are mine and my own.
My "Studio" logo was made to reference that I am a huge nerd and love programming, hence the for style infinite loop.
